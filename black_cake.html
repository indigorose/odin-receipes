				<h4>Steps</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						In a large, air-tight container combine the prunes,
						raisins, currants, cherries, and citrus peel, all of the
						brandy, and 3 cups of the rum. Stir to combine and set
						aside for at least three days and up 3 months.
					</li>
					<li>
						When ready to bake, working in batches, place the
						alcohol saturated fruit in a food processor. Slowly
						pulse to a rough paste, ensuring that some of the fruit
						remains somewhat intact. If needed, add more brandy to
						thin the consistency. Continue this process until all of
						the fruit has been processed. Set aside.
					</li>
					<li>
						Next make the "browning." In a heavy-bottomed pot over
						medium high heat, add the granulated sugar and stir with
						a wooden spoon until it has melted. Continue stirring
						until the sugar darkens. It will indeed smoke. Don’t
						panic. When the sugar is almost black, carefully stir in
						the boiling water. Take caution, because it will
						splatter. Turn off heat.
					</li>
					<li>
						Prepare cake pans with butter and a double layer of
						parchment paper. Preheat oven to 250°F. (Note: Because
						this cake is so dense, it seldom rises. As such,
						employing relatively shallow baking pans are necessary).
					</li>
					<li>
						In a stand mixer or by hand, cream the butter and brown
						sugar until fluffy aerated. One at time, combine the
						eggs, then the lime zest, essences, and bitters.
						Transfer this mixture to a very large bowl. Then, in a
						separate bowl combine the dry ingredients: flour, baking
						powder, cinnamon and nutmeg. Gently fold the dry
						ingredients into the butter mixture. Stir in the fruit
						and a 1/4 cup of the browning. The batter should be dark
						brown; if it's too light add in more of the browning, a
						tablespoon at a time.
					</li>
					<li>
						Divide batter among prepared cake pans. The batter will
						not rise very much, so fill pans a hair off the top.
						Bake for one hour, then reduce heat to 225°F. Continue
						to bake for 2 1/2 to 3 hours longer. Check for
						completion using a tester, which when inserted should
						come out clean. Allow the cakes to cool on a wire rack.
					</li>
					<li>
						10 minutes after the cakes have been retrieved from the
						oven, and they are cooling on the wire rack, brush the
						top of the cakes with more rum and allow it to soak in.
						Continue this process about every 30 minutes while the
						cakes cool.
					</li>
					<li>
						The cakes can be served one small slice at a time, as is
						custom in the Caribbean. To store, wrap them in wax
						paper first, then wrap in foil. These cakes keep for up
						to a month in a cool dry place.
					</li>
