				<h4>Ingredients</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>1/4 large white onion, left whole</li>
					<li>6 roma tomatoes, cored</li>
					<li>3 to 4 chiles serranos, stemmed</li>
					<li>2 garlic cloves, unpeeled</li>
					<li>Kosher salt</li>
					<li>
						1 tablespoon to 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
						(optional)
					</li>
					<li>6 tablespoons lard or bacon fat, divided</li>
					<li>8 ounces fresh chorizo</li>
					<li>
						2 (15-oz.) cans black beans, or equivalent amount of
						freshly cooked beans and their liquid
					</li>
					<li>6 large eggs</li>
					<li>6 tostadas</li>
					<li>4 ounces queso fresco, crumbled</li>
					<li>1 large avocado, sliced</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Steps</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Place a piece of foil over a medium skillet (preferably
						cast iron) and heat over high. Place tomatoes, serranos,
						onion, and garlic and cook, undisturbed, until charred
						on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes for garlic, 4 to 5 minutes
						for serrano and onion, 10 to 12 for tomatoes. Transfer
						to the jar of a blender and add 1 teaspoon salt and
						puree on low speed until vegetables are broken up.
						Gradually increase speed to medium-low and puree until
						salsa is almost smooth but some chunks remain. Don’t be
						tempted to put it on high or you will incorporate air
						into the salsa and it will look and taste more like a
						smoothie than a salsa. Transfer to a medium bowl, stir
						in 1 tablespoon lime juice and season with more salt and
						more lime juice if necessary. Remove and discard foil
						and set salsa aside until ready to serve.
					</li>
					<li>
						Heat 1 tablespoon of lard in the same skillet over
						medium-high. Cook chorizo, breaking up large clumps with
						a spoon, until browned and fully cooked, 6 to 8 minutes.
						Transfer to a small bowl, leaving oil behind. Add 3
						tablespoons lard and cook remaining chopped onion,
						stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 6
						minutes. Add beans and their liquid (that's right—don't
						drain them!). Bring to a boil and cook, stirring
						occasionally, until liquid is reduced slightly, about 5
						minutes. Using a potato masher, smash beans until almost
						no whole beans remain and mixture is thick, smooth, and
						creamy, like the consistency of sour cream. Remove from
						heat, taste and season with salt if necessary, and let
						cool slightly; the refried beans will thicken as they
						sit.
					</li>
					<li>
						Meanwhile, cook the eggs. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons
						lard in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Crack
						eggs into skillet, leaving space around each one, and
						cook until whites are set and edges are crisp, about 4
						minutes. Season with kosher salt.
					</li>
					<li>
						Spread about 1/3 cup of beans over each tostada, top
						with chorizo, egg, salsa, a sprinkle of queso fresco,
						and avocado slices.
					</li>
				</ol>
